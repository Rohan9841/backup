 * Program Description: This program is designed to help dieter choose certain foods based on their calorie goals.
						A certain number of facts are first written by hard code first. Then, we create rules that 
                        use those facts to display certain foods that the dieter can use. The program has only two 
                        calorie goals (1200 and 1800).

%% <---------------------------Declaring facts for the program--------------------------------------------->


/* 
   The proteins listed below are low in fat, and are the protein foods the dieter should choose most often. 
   Higher fat meats and dairy products, for instance, will have more calories.
 */
protein('1 Cup (250g) plain nonfat yogurt').
protein('1 Cup (250g) vanilla nonfat yogurt').
protein('1 Cup (250g) nonfat cottage cheese').
protein('3 ounces (85g) cooked poultry').

protein('4 ounces (100g) shellfish').
protein('1 cup (250 ml) nonfat milk').

protein('1 whole egg + 4 egg whites').
protein('7 egg whites').
protein('5 ounces (125g) tofu').

/* 
   Fresh or frozen fruits are generally better choices than dried fruits or fruit juices, since the dieters will be 
   getting the largest portion size for the calories they are eating.
 */
fruit('1 cup (80g) of cut fruit').
fruit('1 cup (80g) of berries').
fruit('1 average piece of fruit(apple,orange,banana,etc.)').

/* 
   With the exception of starchy vegetables (such as corn and peas, which are listed with the starches), vegetables 
   have the fewest calories per bite of any foods. In fact, the calories in leafy greens such as lettuce are so low 
   that they can be eaten in any amount.
 */
vegetable('1 cup (80g) any vegetable').
vegetable('Leafy greens - any amounnt').

/* 
   The foods listed in this group are whole grain. They provide more vitamins, minerals and fiber than refined “white”
   starches, like white rice or white bread. 
 */
starch('1/2 cup (150g) cooked grain(rice,pasta,quiona,etc)').
starch('1/2 cup (150g) beans').

starch('1/2 large sweet potato').
starch('1 cup (250g) cooked rooled oats').
starch('2 corn tortillas').

/* 
   Protein snacks contain fewer calories and less protein than a full portion of protein. These smaller protein provide 
   “boosts” during the day help to keep hunger at bay.
 */
protein_snack('1 Protein Snack Bar Deluxe').
protein_snack('1 ounce (30g) roasted soy nuts').
protein_snack('1 cup (250 ml) nonfat milk').

protein_snack('1 ounce (30g) low-fat mozzarella cheese').
protein_snack('1/2 cup (85g) edamame soybeans').

/* 
   Small amounts of fats or sweets can be used to add flavor to the foods. Each of the following items contains 60-75 
   calories, which is why it is limited in the diet plans. Although avocado is technically a fruit, most of its calories 
   come from fat so it’s counted as a taste enhancer. Similarly, while nuts do contain modest amounts of protein, most 
   of the calories in nuts also come from fat so they are placed here.
 */
enhancer('2 TSP (10 ml) olive oil').
enhancer('2 TSP (10 ml) canola oil').
enhancer('2 TSP (10 ml) sunflower oil').
enhancer('2 TSP (10 ml) safflower oil').
